def get_image_from_cellphone_camera(url, video_width):
	
	"""
	This function returns the feed from a cellphone camera as a numpy array.
	Launch the server on the "IP Webcam" android app before using this function.
	The laptop/Raspberry Pi and the cellphone need to be on the same wifi network.

	-----------------------------
	imutils: $ sudo pip3 install imutils
	urllib: Did not need to be installed.
	
	
	Arguments:
	----------
	
	url -- The url taken from the app. shot.jpg is added
	because we are taking continuous screen shots.
	Example:
	# url = 'http://192.168.0.102:8080/shot.jpg'
	
	video_width -- the required width of the output video image, integer
	Example: 
	If the specified width is 640 then the output image shape 
	will be: 480x640.
	
	Returns:
	--------
	
	image -- the image frame as a numpy array with shape: (h, video_width, 3)
	The height gets assigned automatically by the android app.
	The image looks to be in RGB format.
