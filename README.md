## Scary TV Triggered by Computer Vision

In progress...

This project uses a Raspberry Pi 3, OpenCV and the MediaPipe pose detection model to trigger a scary portrait on a smart TV. When the model detects that someone is waving at the TV, the code triggers a portrait to come to life and scare the viewer.
